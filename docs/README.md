# Project Documentation

This `/docs` folder is the **single source of truth** for your project.
Fill it in when starting a new project. Keep it updated as the project evolves.

**AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) should read this folder before writing any code.**

## Recommended First Prompt (new session)

```text
Read all files in /docs.

Do not write code yet.

Analyze the project documentation and tell me:
1. What the project is
2. What is the MVP scope
3. What is the current status (from 09_CURRENT_STATUS.md)
4. What the next task should be (from 08_BACKLOG.md)
5. What risks you see
```

## Workflow

1. Start session → read `09_CURRENT_STATUS.md` + `08_BACKLOG.md`
2. Pick one task → implement it
3. After completion → update `09_CURRENT_STATUS.md`
4. Commit with Conventional Commits message
5. Update `14_CHANGELOG.md` if user-visible change

See `.claude/prompts.md` for structured prompts for each scenario.
