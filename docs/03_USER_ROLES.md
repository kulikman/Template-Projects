# User Roles

## Overview

This project uses Supabase Auth + a `profiles.role` column for role-based access control.
RLS policies enforce permissions at the database level — never rely on frontend-only checks.

## RLS Pattern

Every table must have policies that enforce role boundaries:

```sql
-- Users can only read/write their own rows
CREATE POLICY "users_own_data" ON [table]
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Admins can read all rows
CREATE POLICY "admins_read_all" ON [table]
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM profiles
      WHERE id = auth.uid() AND role IN ('admin', 'super_admin')
    )
  );
```
